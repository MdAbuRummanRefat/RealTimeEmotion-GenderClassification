# RealTimeEmotion-GenderClassification
A robust ensemble model to detect emotion&amp;gender in real time using web cam
We implement a general Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for designing for real and
validated our model by creating a real time vision with accomplishes the task of face
detection, gender and emotion classification simultaneously. We got accuracies of 95% in
the IMDB-/WIKI age and gender dataset and 66% in the FER emotion recognition
dataset. We have used real time guided back propagation technique to visualize the
weighted real time CNN that uncovered the dynamic weight change and evaluate the
learning feature. We think in the modern CNN architecture regularization and
visualization of previous hidden layer features are necessary in order to reduce the gap
between slow performances and real time architecture.
