# RealTimeEmotion-GenderClassification
A robust ensemble model to detect emotion\& gender in real time using webcam.\
We implement a general Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for designing for real and validated our model by creating a real time vision with accomplishes the task of face detection, gender and emotion classification simultaneously. We got accuracies of 95% in the IMDB-/WIKI age and gender dataset and 66% in the FER emotion recognition dataset. We have used real time guided back propagation technique to visualize the weighted real time CNN that uncovered the dynamic weight change and evaluate the learning feature. We think in the modern CNN architecture regularization and visualization of previous hidden layer features are necessary in order to reduce the gap between slow performances and real time architecture.
* IMDB gender classification test accuracy: 95%.
* fer2013 emotion classification test accuracy: 66%.
